             It is a long established fact that a <strong>reader</strong> <!--this will bold-->
            will be distracted by the readable <emphasize>content of a</emphasize> <!--this will italic-->
             page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum 
             is that it has a more-or-less normal <u>distribution</u> of letters, <!--underlines-->
              as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like 
             readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors<br> <!--will break line-->
              now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 
             'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
             Various versions have evolved over the years, 
             sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
